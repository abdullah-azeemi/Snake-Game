# Snake-Game
 The snake game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake navigating a grid. The objective is to eat food and grow in length without colliding with the boundaries of the game or the snake's own body. This implementation in C++ using structs and the Windows.h library provides a visually appealing interface and uses keyboard inputs to control the snake's movement. The game tracks the score, updates the display in real-time.
The game also offers the exciting feature of multiplayer support, allowing up to four players to compete simultaneously. Each player controls their own snake on the grid, striving to outmaneuver their opponents while collecting food to grow larger.
